1. Control servos and allow rotate them only in specific ranges
2. Read echo sensor and stop tank on distance less than 10 sm
3. Change lamp to red when disatance less than 30 sm and increase HUE when distance is still decreasing
4. Use 3 values from RC recivier to determine average PWM. Or remove noise (jump +- 5) from signal.
